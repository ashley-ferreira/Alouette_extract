    "#### Introduction (to the issues we attempt to quantify)\r\n",
    "There are two potentail issues with the scanning we are trying to isolate and get an idea for how prevelant they are:\r\n",
    "1. Images are cropped too soon (causes aspect ratio to be less wide than expected)\r\n",
    "2. Images are out of phase (can see two sets of metadata on either side of ionogram instead of middle)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#1 is the easiest to detect by just reading in the pixel scale and calculating the aspect ratio, wheras for #2 we need to use an optical character regonition program to estimate the number of characters in the metadata. Both of these cause us to not be able to see the ionogram trace correctly. Images like first and last ones of most subdirs are supposed to be off and not have the normal ionogram aspect ratios so it is normal to expect a certain small rate of these images."
